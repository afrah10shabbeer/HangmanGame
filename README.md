**ï»¿HangmanGame**

In this version of Hangman, each time the player guesses an incorrect letter, their "life" count decreases by one. Once the life count reaches zero, the player is considered "hanged" and the game ends. The hangman graphical representation is progressively built with each incorrect guess, and when the hangman is fully constructed, the player loses. This adds an element of tension and urgency to the game, as the player must balance their guesses with the risk of losing all their lives.
